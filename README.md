# Nukit
Native UI Kit - Made for electron. This project is still under development, you can
use anything as you want as long as it works but dont hate me if it does not.
If you are searching for a more complete css framework this might not be the right repo for you.

The design is inspired by [Zoomy](http://zoommyapp.com/) and the [Photon UI Kit](https://github.com/connors/photon). Some code might even be shamelessly copy pasted from the Photon UI Kit (MIT license rocks).
